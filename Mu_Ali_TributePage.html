            Muhammad Ali (1942-2016), born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., was an American professional boxer,
            widely regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time. He became the world heavyweight
            champion at the age of 22 and went on to win the title three times in his career.

            Ali was not only known for his boxing skills but also for his charismatic personality and
            activism outside the ring. He was a vocal advocate for civil rights and opposed the Vietnam War,
            even facing legal consequences for his stance.
